# 🏥 Healthcare Appointment No-Show Prediction

This project uses machine learning and Power BI to predict whether a patient will miss a scheduled medical appointment and provides strategic recommendations to reduce no-show rates.

---

## 📚 Project Objective

- Predict whether a patient will miss their scheduled medical appointment.
- Analyze historical appointment data to discover trends in no-show behavior.
- Create a Power BI dashboard to visualize patterns and support decision-making.
- Recommend strategies to improve attendance and optimize scheduling.

## 📋 Steps Followed

1. **Data Cleaning** – Handled date parsing, removed invalid ages, encoded categories  
2. **EDA** – Analyzed trends like SMS reminders, weekdays, and waiting time  
3. **Feature Engineering** – Added new columns like `waiting_days`, `appointment_day_of_week`  
4. **Modeling** – Trained Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost models  
5. **Evaluation** – Compared models using Accuracy and F1 Score  
6. **Visualization** – Designed a Power BI dashboard to show insights

## 🔍 Model Performance

| Model              | Accuracy | F1 Score |
|-------------------|----------|----------|
| Decision Tree      | 60.53%   | ~0.61    |
| XGBoost            | 83.48%   | ~0.83    |
| Random Forest      | 84.68%   | ~0.85    |

## 📊 Dashboard

- Built in Power BI (`Medical.pbix`)
- Visuals include:
  - No-show by weekday, age, gender
  - Impact of SMS reminders
  - Correlation with waiting time and chronic conditions

## 💡 Key Insights

- Higher no-shows observed on Mondays
- SMS reminders significantly increase attendance
- Elderly patients prefer afternoon appointments
- Prior no-show history is a strong predictor
- Long waiting days negatively impact attendance

---

## ✅ Recommendations

- Send SMS reminders 24–48 hours in advance
- Avoid scheduling high-risk patients on Mondays
- Use follow-up calls for patients with no-show history
- Prioritize elderly for late-day slots
- Explore telehealth options for distant neighborhoods
